# cssTextAnim

This is a simple take on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJNVramny9k&t=282s){:target="_blank"} I randomly found.

I used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/){:target="_blank"} to generate the SVG and that didn't go too well so I had to fiddle with sizes/positions and translation
to get something visible.
Maybe another tool would have been simpler for me to use and generate the exact output I meeded.
The javascript code will regenerate the animation based on the text, so no more copy/pasting here.

This code in itself is just a test and won't probably grow to anything
but this may be useful as part of another one later one.

# Possible improvements

- Get rid of the `<g transform>` and get proper position straight away
- Generate SVG on the fly based on user imput
- Clean up generated code
